#Executive Summary
Our company, like many others is rapidly growing and adapting to changes in the workplace.  With these adaptations comes new challenges and ways of thinking in order to solve these issues.  Our goal is to make processes and adaptations to the process as smooth as possible throughout all levels of the company.  

The issue we are facing today is the decision to engage with external source to better serve and advance our company.  We feel that it is much easier to deal with the complications of external source than to spend the time, money, and resources to develop everything we need in-house.  

Our solution to better serve everyone involved is to engage and continue engaging with external source to better our services and products.  Throughout the documents attached to this summary are all of the steps and processes that we needed to mitigate risks associated with external source.  These documents are important in daily operations and development to ensure that we are reduce risk, understand what thresholds are acceptable, and communicate effeciently every step of the way.  

We need to address these risks immedietly and continue to follow the guidelines set forth by the documents attached to ensure we remain competitive in the market, keep the integrity of our product, and ensure security for all parties involved with our organization.
